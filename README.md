# QM/MM Simulations of Afatinib-EGFR Addition: the Role of Î²-Dimethylaminomethyl Substitution

QM/MM simulations of the afatinib reaction with the front pocket cysteine C797 in the EGFR kinase. This is a model system for understanding the mechanism of acrylamide warheads with unreactive cysteines in proteins.
